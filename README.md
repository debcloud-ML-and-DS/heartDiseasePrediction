## Objective
The Aim of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict if a perform have heart disease or not.

## Lagorithms used
Random Forest

## Hyperparameter tuning technique
* RandomizedSearchCV
* GridSearchCV

## Steps
* Okay so I explored the dataset by check for null values, categorical datasets and many other exploratory steps.
* Perfomred my preprocessing steps.
* Split the dataset into training and testing
* Build model
* Performed Hyper-parameter tuning on model
* Made predictions.
* Saved my model.

## Scores
* Accuracy Score: 82

Any other information can be found in the notebook.
